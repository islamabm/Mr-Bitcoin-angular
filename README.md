This Angular application allows users to manage a list of contacts. Users can add, edit, and remove contacts, as well as view details about each contact. The application uses a local storage system to store and manage contact information.

Main Features:
1. View a list of contacts with their name, email, phone number, and profile picture.
2. Search for contacts by name, phone number, or email.
3. Add new contacts with a name, email, and phone number.
4. Edit existing contact details.
5. Delete contacts from the list.
6. Keep track of user's coins and moves (transfer coins to contacts).

This application has been built using Angular, a popular web development framework that enables the creation of dynamic and responsive web applications. The app utilizes Angular components, services, and directives to manage the various features and maintain a clean, modular codebase.
